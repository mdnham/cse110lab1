## Introduction
> Because people don't have wings... we look for ways to fly.

Hello! My name is Makayla Nham, and I am a 4th year at UCSD (Sixth College) studying **Math CS**. I will _hopefully_ graduate by Spring 2022 as long as I am able to get into the classes I am interested in. ~~CSE 110 is one of them, please get me off the waitlist.~~

## My CS Experience So Far
`ellipse(x, y, w, h);`

The first CS-related course I've ever taken was a programming class in my sophomore year of high school. Though, rather than your typical class, it actually heavily relied on Khan Academy to teach us JavaScript (specifically Drawing and Animation). Despite this, I did enjoy learning how to code, and so I later took AP Computer Science in my junior year. And now, I hope to have a career in the industry.

However, being a Math CS major, there is some difficulty in getting the CSE classes that I am interested in, so hopefully I can get into all of them! I hope to broaden my horizons through CSE 110 ~~if I can get in~~.

## More About Me
When I'm not stressing over classes, I like to spend my free time either doodling, reading comics, or watching anime. I also occasionally play games, specifically [Project SEKAI](https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/Project_SEKAI_COLORFUL_STAGE!) or [Elsword](https://elwiki.net/w/Elsword_(game)).

I haven't actually watched new anime for a few months now, but I still read pretty often. If you're interested in slice of life and/or romance, please check out these series if you haven't yet!

- Haikyuu!! (I definitely recommend reading the manga! Also the source of the quote in [Introduction](#introduction))
- Acchi Kocchi
- Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge
- [Gourmet Hound](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/gourmet-hound/list?title_no=1245&page=1) (Free on Webtoon!)
- [Seasons of Blossom](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/seasonsofblossom/list?title_no=2509&page=1) (Also free!)

I find doodling rather calming, and so I tend to have small doodles on the side of my notes from time to time. However, I also do [sketches](http://github.com/mdnham/cse110lab1/sketches.png) on my iPad (Procreate) whenever I can!
